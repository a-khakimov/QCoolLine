# QCoolLine

## What is it?

The program for drawing the shortest possible lines on the stage. 
When starting, obstacles are randomly placed on the stage, then you need to specify point **–ê** and point **B**, after which a line will be drawn that shows the smallest length between these points.

Code was written using Qt Creator.
For finding shortest lines between points, I used Breadth-first search algorithm.

# How run it?

To run the program, install **Qt Creator**, open the project and run it.
There should be no problem.
